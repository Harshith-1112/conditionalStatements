Assignment Question: 

Student Grade Evaluation using Ternary Operator Question:

Write a Java program named Student Grade that reads a student's marks (integer input) and determines their grade using a nested ternary operator as per the following conditions:

Marks Range            Grade

90 and above            A
80-89                   B
70-79                   C
60-69                   D
50-59                   E
Below 50                F

A rate of 15 per kilometer for the next 8 kilometers.
A rate of 10 per kilometer for distances above 10 kilometers.
Additionally, if the distance is more than 20 kilometers, the fare gets a 5% discount.


*** vvimp for interview question

What are the difference between JVM,JRE,JDK.


JVM:(Java Virtual Machine)

Responsible for executing java byte code.
Provide platform independence (WORA).
Performs JIT(Just-In-Time) compilation for faster execution.
Handles memory management and garbage collection.
Memory area are like hep, stack, method area, pc registers, native method stacks.


JRE: JVM+libraries Set

Provides libraries, classes, and other files need to run java programs.
contains JVM+core libraries.
doesn't include compiler or tools for development

JDK: JVM+JRE+ developer tools

includes everything in JRE, plus development tools
.javac (complier)
jar(archiver)
Javadoc (documentation generator)
used by developers to create and compile and debug java application.


you only want to run a java application ==>JRE
you want to develop and run java programs --> JDK
you want to explain or visualize execution --> JVM.
